Most of our interviewees had trouble navigating the app and found the interface cluttered with unused features, and many of them were seeing only algorithm-suggested content when they wanted to see posts from friends. The Facebook custom homepage alleviates these issues by allowing users to tailor their experience on the platform to their goals.",
